# project-1 That's My Jam
Group Project

An app that lets a user see their friends' restaurant reviews on a map, in order find nearby restaurants they'd like to try.
Users can see their friends' instagram food photos that were taken in that location.
Users can also add their own instragram food photos, using #thatsmyjam so their friends in the area can see how good their food was.

using google map API
and instragram API
and firebase


## program flow:

### to add an instagram photo
* user takes a food photo and posts in their instagram account 
* user must use the hashtag #thatsmyjam 
* user must have a location set for the post

### to use the app
* user logs in to the app w their instagram credentials
* look up their IG username in our DB of users, add if new user
* retrieve their user info and friends list from IG
* add / update their user info and friends list in our DB
* retrieve their tagged photos from IG, add to the DB if new

* integrate google places to make adding a new location easier/more accurate
* ability to save your friends filter state for next login
